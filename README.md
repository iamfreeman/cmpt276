Description
Alzheimer’s is a disease that effects not only the patient but everyone who is close to them. You may find yourself worried that your family members might one day forget where they live and wonder off. In fact, 6/10 people will wonder off and get lost! [1] Or maybe you are worried that they are taking too many trips to the pharmacy buying over the counter drugs or the casino spending their money and not remembering how much they lost. While you may not always be able to be by their side, with Safety Beacon you can rest easy knowing you have a direct link to their current and previous whereabouts. [2]
